Thank you for downloading the ZYBORK Demo!

This game is by Kadable (me), and is made in Pygame.

--How To Play the Game--

To play the game, double-click on ZYBORKDemo.exe, select extract, and select the location
you want the extracted files to go to. Now go to this newly created folder (called the same name as 
the .zip file) and double click on ZYBORKDemo.exe to play the game.

--Controls--

Arrow keys or WASD to move.
Spacebar, up arrow or W to jump.
Bouncing off of a wall resets your double jump!

--Notes--

This demo is really short, as it is mainly me testing out any problems on other computers.
The full game will have 23 levels, cutscenes and all that jazz finished games tend to have.

Thank you for playing :)
