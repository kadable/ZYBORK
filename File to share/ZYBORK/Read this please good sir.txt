Thank you for downloading ZYBORK!

This game is by Kadable (me, Kade Hennessy), and is made in Pygame.

--How To Play the Game--

To play the game, double-click on ZYBORK.exe, select extract, and select the location
you want the extracted files to go to. Now go to this newly created folder (called the same name as 
the .zip file) and double click on ZYBORK.exe to play the game.

--Controls--

Arrow keys or WASD to move.
Spacebar, up arrow or W to jump.
Bouncing off of walls resets your double jump!
Press enter to advance cutscenes, dialouge and screens!

--Notes--

There is a little surprise at the end if you unlock all the medals :)
If you are too lazy to get them you can just replace the 'no's in medal_data.txt with yes (you dirty cheater, you).

This is my first game so feedback would be extra appreciated!

--Shameful Plugs--
